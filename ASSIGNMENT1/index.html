    Perroni was a member of the popular band RBD, which was launched off of the success of the most-watched telenovela in years, Rebelde. To date, RBD has made 9 studio albums, including albums in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide, and have embarked on various international tours including shows throughout Latin America and Europe.
Mai composed "Tal Vez Mañana", for RBD's fourth Spanish language album, Empezar Desde Cero and sang solo on the title track for the album.On August 8, 2008, RBD released a message telling fans that they had decided to split up. They went on one final tour, Gira Del Adios World Tour, which ended in early 2009. Perroni was absent part of the tour, due to her filming of Cuidado con el ángel.
For her role in Cuidado con el ángel, Perroni recorded three songs for the show called "Esta Soledad", "Separada De Ti", and "Contigo".
She recorded a song with Reik, entitled "Mi Pecado", which was used as the opening song for the telenovela, Mi Pecado.
On July 17, 2010, Mai released her new single "No Vuelvas", which was featured on an EP she released for her Brazilian Pocket Show performances, on her website MaiteMVP.com.She recorded a song with Marco di Mauro called "A Partir De Hoy" which forms part of the musical soundtrack of the telenovela Triunfo del Amor, her third lead role.</p>

<h3>MY HOBBIES</h3>
<p>Her popularity was cemented in 2008 when she was selected by Mexico's youth to become one of the first Latin women to have an iconic Barbie doll fashioned after her. The Maite Perroni Barbie was a success in Mexico, elsewhere in Latin America, the United States, and Spain.She has won numerous awards including the Tvynovelas Award's "Best Young Actress" for the soap opera, "Cuidado con el Ángel" (Careful with the Angel), Tvynovelas Award's "Most Popular Social Media Artist 2011", "Alta Inspiration Award 2016" by Alta Med, Tvynovelas Award's "Best Actress in a Leading Role" and "Favorite Leading Actress" at the "Premios Juventud 2016" both for the soap opera "Antes Muerta Que Lichita" (Anything But Plain).She released her first solo album in 2013, entitled "Eclipse de Luna" (Moon Eclipse). The release of the music video for the album's first single, "Tu y Yo" was during the "Premios Juventud 2013" (2013 Youth Awards), which aired on Univision and was seen by over 13 million viewers. The CD reached #2 on the U.S. Latin Pop Charts.</p>

    <div class = "right"><h4>MY GOALS</h4>

    <p>"She's a different, atypical kind of character, who goes through a real and very human process, because in her struggle to get where she wants to be, Lichita takes a wrong turn and eventually becomes a very different person, someone who isn't her at all nor wants to be," Perroni told EFE.This human process is one with which the former member of the internationally famed Mexican musical group RBD can identify."Lichita longs for success but at a certain point in time realizes that success isn't everything. For me it's the same as far as fame is concerned. Fame doesn't satisfy my soul and never was my goal. What I'm passionate about is my work, reaching out to people, giving them something special," Perroni said.The actress, who will share star billing with Arath de la Torre and Chantal Andere, said that Lichita made her realize that she might not have taken a road well traveled from the outset of her career, but it was the only one for her.</p>

	<h2><b>interesting facts about rabbits</b></h2>

	<p>Rabbits and bunnies are the same animal – there’s no difference in breed or species, just the word we prefer.Rabbits and hares are “lagomorphs”, an order that also includes the pika, a small burrowing mammal that looks like a large mouse and lives in colder climates.Lagomorphs were originally classified as rodents, but in 1912 the distinction was made between them and rodents.Hares are born with their eyes open, hair covering their bodies, and they can run within a few minutes of birth (much like a Guinea pig!).  Rabbits, on the other hand, are born blind, naked, and remain in a fur-lined nest for the first days of their lives.Jackrabbits, which belong to the genus “Lepus,” have been clocked at speeds of 45 miles per hour.Stories abound about the prolific reproductive nature of rabbits and so it is not surprising that the rabbit should have become a symbol of fertility in many cultures and religions.  As the Christian influence spread, this symbol became associated with Easter.Rabbits are meticulously clean animals and are easy to house break and train.  Much like a dog, a pet rabbit can be taught to come to his/her name, sit in your lap, and do simple tricks.Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” they jump up in the air and twist and spin around!A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck.  A group of rabbits is called a herd.</p>
